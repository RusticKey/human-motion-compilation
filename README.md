# Human Motion and Novel View Synthesis Compilation

## What is this?
  This project page is a collection of papers (and possibly code) that has something to do with human motion synthesis and novel view synthesis in 2D and 3D space. Papers should be chronologically ordered. This project page is only intended to supplement my studies and research where everything is (hopefully nicely) organized into one place.
