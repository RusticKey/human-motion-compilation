# Human Motion and Novel View Synthesis Compilation

## What is this?
  This project page is a collection of papers (and possibly code) that has something to do with human motion synthesis and novel view synthesis in 2D and 3D space. There are two major method classes when doing it in 2D space:
  * Spatial Transformation (using flow information, etc)
  * Conditioned Generation (pose label map, etc)
  
  Papers should be chronologically ordered. This project page is only intended to supplement my studies and research where everything is (hopefully nicely) organized into one place. Papers are also split into several sub-categories (ones with the project page):
  * Novel View Synthesis - This category is about rendering/generating an image of a human within another pose
  * Motion Retargeting, Representation, Continuation - This category is about the modeling of human motion as well as skeletal prediction
  * Textured 3D Human Reconstruction - From a single image, this category deals with 3D human generation along with texture and shape inference from unseen angles
 
 Papers that do not have first-party implementations are put into another category with two sub-categories:
  * Architectural - Contribution is mainly about architecture
  * Representation - Contribution is related to information representation, spatial representation, or feature extraction methods
